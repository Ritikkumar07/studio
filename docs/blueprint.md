# **App Name**: Course Explorer

## Core Features:

- Course Listing: Display a scrollable list of available courses with title, brief description, and instructor name.
- Search and Filter: Allow users to search for courses by keywords and filter them based on categories (e.g., programming, design, marketing).
- Course Details: Show a dedicated page for each course, including full description, instructor bio, and list of modules/lessons. Each module/lesson will just be displayed with a text description, no actual video streaming will be set up as this is just the MVP.
- Personalized Recommendations: Recommend courses to the user using a tool that learns user preferences and browsing history, tailoring results to the individual.  AI models are costly, so focus on one key AI-powered element only.
- Curriculum Summary: Allow AI to generate a summary of the curriculum for the user, giving an idea of the scope of material the course will cover. An LLM "tool" determines if and how key pieces of information will be incorporated.
- Static Content: Include static "About" and "Contact" pages.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust, stability, and knowledge. Derived from the educational content; provides a sense of authority without feeling too corporate; mid-range saturation will create a more relaxed learning environment.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E8EAF6). Background maintains thematic similarity with primary color, but allows a light, readable experience. This subdued approach will prevent distraction, so learning is the central experience.
- Accent color: Purple (#9C27B0) for highlights, links, and interactive elements; should be used sparingly to draw attention.
- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif font for a clean and modern user experience in both headings and body text.
- Use simple, line-based icons to represent course categories and actions; avoid excessive detail.
- Clean and minimal layout with clear information hierarchy; prioritize readability and ease of navigation.
- Subtle transitions and animations for a smooth user experience (e.g., fade-in effects, hover animations).
